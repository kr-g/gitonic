# OPEN ISSUES

refer to [issues](https://github.com/kr-g/gitonic/issues)


# LIMITATIONS

- ~~currently the tracked workspace is fix located under `~/repo`~~
  - ~~provided in version v0.0.2~~
- difftool only works with unstaged files, no diff on already staged or 
 commited changes (same behavior as cmd-line `git difftool`)
- git credentials basic support, 
 you need to use https://git-scm.com/docs/git-credential-store.
 no separate credit store provided.
- only existing git repo's under the workspace are supported,
 as of now no support to create a new git repo. 
 use `git init`, or `git clone` manually from cmd-line
- `gitonic` interacts with `git` just like starting in bash / commandline.
at the present time there is _no_additional_ error checking. 
this must be done by checking the log tab manually where all cmdline output goes.
